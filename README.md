# DNC-TensorFlow
An implementation of the Differential Neural Computer (DNC) in TensorFlow

**NOTE**: this is currently a work-in-progress

You can currently run the tests for DNC by executing:
```
/DNC-TensorFlow$ python3 -m src.run_tests
```

Alternatively, you can execute individual tests by executing:
```
/DNC-TensorFlow$ python3 -m src.testing.dnc_test
/DNC-TensorFlow$ python3 -m src.testing.write_head_test
```
