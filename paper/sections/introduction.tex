Memory augmented neural networks (MANN) have empowered neural networks with the
ability to solve problems that were previously unsolvable. The Neural Turing
Machine (NTM) \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/GravesWD14} is an early example of a
MANN. The NTM was greatly influenced by neuroscience research in working
memory. Later on, the Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC)
\cite{graves2016hybrid} was created as an enhancement of the architecture
in the NTM.
